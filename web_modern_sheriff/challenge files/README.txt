MODERN SHERIFF

It's 2024 and the Wild Wild West has been Too Wild Too Longâ„¢! This year, we're modernizing our sheriff's office and we made a website where law-abiding citizens such as yourself can submit reports! We've made it possible for you to format your reports and make them all pretty! You can use the following HTML tags in your report: <br>, <h1..6>, <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>

Create a report [here](https://sheriff-report.0xmmalik.repl.co/)!

Once you create your report, you can submit it to our administrator bot who will take a look at it. You can do this by clicking "Submit Report" after you create your report or by putting the report's ID [here](https://sheriff-report.0xmmalik.repl.co/send).

The administrator bot carries some sensitive information in its cookies, so hopefully those don't get stolen!

When you submit a report to the bot, it gets added to a queue and the bot visits the reports in order of submission. The administrator bot has a hard time limit of 6 seconds per report.
