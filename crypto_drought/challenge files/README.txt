DROUGHT

Welcome to the Wild Wild West. Ever since FIPS 186-4 expired in February, our town has been overrun with chaos and outlaws. On top of all that, we've been experiencing the worse drought we've had in years, barely enough bits to go around. We had a falling out with our mayor, and he skipped town after the drought started; he's the only one who can send for more bits to end our drought!

You need to save our town. We'll give you all the information we have about how the mayor sent the message for help and you can impersonate him to get us more bits.

message = "Send more bits!" (no quotes)
